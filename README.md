This project main goal was to analyse the A/B test data of Vanguard, to be able to give a recommendation about the change of its website design change.
So, the big question is should you change your digital interface design to not?

Since I had 4 different DataFrames, I started by joined them, cleaned them and then separate the control and the test group.

The control group who experience the old version of the website, and the test group, that experience the new version. It is important that the two groups are similiar so we can comparate them and draw conclusions. 

From my analysis (age, tenure, log ons) both groups are pretty similiar, so we can compare them.

Both groups had similar completion rate, I performed a z-test of proportions that showed there isnâ€™t a statistically significantly different between the completion rate of the two groups.

Regarding the time clients took to go throughout the all process the test group took more time than the control group. This might be because the clients in the control group are already familiar with the website, since Vanguard clients have been clients for some time now, so are already acquainted with the "old" version of the website, whereas the clients of the test group are experiencing a new one, that they have never seen before.

Regarding the average time spent per step, the control group spent more or less the same time in each step, showing once again that they are familiarise with it, whereas the test group took more time in all of them, specially in step 1.

Taking everything into account, first of all, I would recommend further tests, and I recommend Vanguard to do a new version of step 1 since it was were the test group took the most time. 
Since both groups had similar results regarding the completion rate but the test group took more time to complete the process, taking more time in each step, I recommend you not to change the design of your website, at least for now.
